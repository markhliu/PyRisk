    "# Chapter 16: Annuity, Bond, and Stock Valuation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we explore the valuation of annuities, bonds, and stocks. We begin with an introduction to the concept of the time value of money, which serves as the foundation for creating discounted cash flow models. These models allow us to treat any financial security as a series of cash flows and determine their value accordingly. Specifically, we will apply this framework to the pricing of annuities, bonds, and stocks, the three most fundamental financial instrumets.\n",
