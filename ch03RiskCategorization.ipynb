    "# Chapter 3: Categorizing Risks \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will explore various methods for categorizing risks based on their potential gains, connections to debt, diversifiability, and underlying causes. We will also examine standard risk management strategies. Lastly, we will cover the objectives of risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Categorize risks\n",
    "2. Review risk management strategies\n",
    "3. Identify the costs associated with risks\n",
    "4. Evaluate strategies for minimizing risk costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk is a multifaceted concept that encompasses numerous aspects. Consequently, there are multiple approaches to segmenting risks faced by contemporary businesses, based on the chosen classification criteria. First, we will discuss different ways to categorize risks. After that, we will delve into risk management strategies. Finally, we will discuss the purpose of risk management, especially for modern corporations, including financial institutions."
